*thinking*

To effectively structure the presented information into a markmap, I'll break it down by focusing on the main topic and expanding into clearly defined subtopics. Each subtopic will highlight key concepts or techniques related to the session's focus areas, such as long-term memory, document processing, semantic search, vector databases, hybrid search, integration with external data sources, and graph databases. This will ensure all important areas are covered and organized intuitively.
