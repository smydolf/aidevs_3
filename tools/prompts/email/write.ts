Here's where we stand and where we're headed.

[[abc123]]

These numbers indicate we're addressing user needs. It's a start, but there's more to do.

For Q4, we're adding to our toolkit:

[[def789]]

Each of these features represents a hypothesis about the future of work. AI writing might alter digital communication. Voice commands could change how we interact with software. Integrated video calls might further reduce the distinction between physical and digital workspaces.

Our Q3 results allow us to test these hypotheses. It's up to us to make these tests count.

What are your thoughts on this?

We have a problem with our onboarding process:

[[xyz789]]

Here's what the data tells us:

[[uvw456]]

The typical response might be to add more explanations or tooltips. But let's consider a different question: why do we need onboarding at all?

Imagine a restaurant that gives you instructions on how to order. You'd likely leave. Why should software be different?

Here's a thought: what if our product didn't need onboarding? What if we eliminated everything that requires explanation?

You might say: 'Our product is complex.' But is complexity necessary? Remember, Facebook started with just profiles and a wall. Amazon began with only books.

Consider this approach:

1. Find the one thing that gives users immediate value.
2. Make that happen in the first 30 seconds.
3. Introduce other features only when needed.
4. Simplify the feature selection stage, where we're seeing the highest drop-off.
5. Create a 'learn-as-you-go' system instead of a front-loaded onboarding process.

It might seem like we're reducing functionality. We're not. We're focusing on what matters most.

As Saint-Exup√©ry said, 'Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away.'

Our task: make our product self-explanatory.

Who wants to take on this challenge?

Take care,\n
Alice"
