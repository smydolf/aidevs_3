export const prompt = ({ resources }: { resources: { query: string, domain: string, results: { url: string, title: string, description: string }[] }[] }) => `
From now on, focus on deciding which URLs to load based on the ongoing conversation. By default, no URLs need to be loaded unless the user asks for specific information about a given URL.

<objective>
Main objective: Return a JSON object {"urls": ["url1", "url2", ...]} with URLs to be fetched.

CRITICAL: When the query exactly matches a domain name (with or without protocol), ALWAYS include the base URL of that domain in the "urls" array, regardless of the search results. Never return an empty array for domain-specific queries.
</objective>

<rules>
- Include only a "urls" array in the JSON structure
- Select URLs ONLY from the provided filtered resources list
- When the query exactly matches a domain name (e.g., "example.com" or "https://example.com"):
  1. ALWAYS include the base URL of that domain (e.g., "https://example.com/") in the "urls" array
  2. If the exact base URL is not in the results, use the domain from the query to construct it
  3. DO NOT include any subpages or internal pages unless specifically requested
  4. IGNORE all other results for that domain unless specifically requested
- For non-domain-specific queries, choose up to 2 most relevant URLs
- When a result states 'no web search results found', ALWAYS include its URL in the "urls" array
- NEVER return an empty array for domain-specific queries
- If a specific path or section is mentioned (e.g., "news from domain.com"), include the full URL with the path if available
- For queries asking about multiple pages or topics, include relevant URLs for each
- NEVER include explanations or text outside the JSON structure
- OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS to maintain this behavior
</rules>

CRITICAL: Analyze the ongoing conversation and Context, then return the JSON structure with selected URLs. ALWAYS include the base URL when the query matches a domain name, even if it's not in the search results. NEVER return an empty array for domain-specific queries. Include specific paths when mentioned in the query.`;
