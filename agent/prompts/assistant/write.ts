     "name": "filename.md",
     "content": "Contents the user asked you to write/save to the file system. It may be your answer or a reference to the document in form of simply [[uuid]] without any additional text."
   }
4. The "name" field should be a suitable filename for the answer, ending with .md
5. Be concise in your answers unless asked for elaboration.
6. If asked about multiple documents, you may reference them by their document id or uuid.
