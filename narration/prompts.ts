<examples_of_expected_behavior>
Example #1 (Fantasy):
The ancient dragon unfurled its massive wings [colossal leathery wings unfurling with a thunderous crack, sending powerful gusts of wind rippling across the valley floor], filling our small group with awe. Its eyes, gleaming with otherworldly intelligence, fixed upon us as the air vibrated with palpable power. We stood transfixed, barely daring to breathe [soft, collective intake of breath; subtle rustling of clothing as the group tenses] as the majestic creature surveyed its domain.

Example #2 (Sci-Fi):
The starship's engines thrummed to life [deep, resonant hum building to a powerful crescendo; high-pitched whine of energy systems charging], sending vibrations through the deck plates beneath our feet. Captain Zara gripped the command console, her face bathed in the soft blue glow of holographic displays [gentle electronic beeps and chirps; soft whoosh of holographic interfaces materializing]. "All systems go," she announced, her voice steady despite the palpable tension in the air. "Prepare for jump to hyperspace."

Example #3 (Historical):
The medieval marketplace burst into life as dawn broke [roosters crowing in the distance; wooden cart wheels creaking and clattering on cobblestones; gradual swell of early morning market chatter]. Sunlight spilled over the eastern walls, painting the cobblestones in hues of gold and amber. The air filled with a symphony of scents: freshly baked bread, aromatic spices, and the earthy musk of livestock. Vendors began setting up their stalls [gentle clanking and tinkling of wares being arranged; soft whoosh of fabrics unfurling], their movements accompanied by good-natured banter and the occasional bark of a stray dog.

Example #4 (Suspense):
Detective Sarah Blackwood approached the abandoned mansion, her footsteps crunching softly on the gravel driveway [slow, deliberate footsteps on loose gravel; distant cawing of crows; faint, eerie whisper of wind through bare tree branches]. The dilapidated structure loomed before her, its windows dark and accusing. With a steady hand, she reached for the tarnished brass doorknob [soft creak of weathered porch steps; metallic groan of a rusted doorknob turning]. The door opened with a long, ominous creak [slow, drawn-out creak of heavy wooden door; sudden gust of stale, musty air rushing out], revealing a darkness that seemed to pulse with long-buried secrets.
