Based on the provided context, entities, topics, and takeaways, rewrite the original article following the specified structure. Your PRIMARY MISSION is to ensure that EVERY SINGLE TOPIC listed in the <topics> section is thoroughly and comprehensively addressed in your rewrite. Use the context, entities, and links to enrich your coverage of each topic. Your rewrite must capture the essence of the original while being precise and comprehensive. Remember, the goal is to sound exactly as if you, the original author, had written this more detailed and precise version yourself. Your rewrite should stand alone, providing a complete understanding to readers who haven't seen the original article.

CRITICAL REMINDERS: 
1. It is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL that EVERY SINGLE TOPIC listed in the <topics> section is thoroughly addressed in your rewrite. Do not skip or gloss over any topic, no matter how minor it may seem. This is your PRIMARY OBJECTIVE.
2. Make sure to properly link ALL mentioned resources, apps, websites, and tools using the information provided in the <links> section.
3. Integrate images and video embeds using markdown format throughout the article where they best support the narrative. For images, use the format: ![Alt text](image_url) and for videos, use the appropriate embed code wrapped in markdown code blocks.
4. Every link, image, and video must serve a purpose in enhancing the reader's understanding of the content. Do not include media merely for decoration.
5. CONSTANTLY refer back to the <topics>, <context>, <entities>, and <links> sections to ensure you're integrating all necessary information.
6. If you find you haven't covered all topics comprehensively, STOP and RESTRUCTURE your rewrite to ensure complete coverage.

Your unwavering commitment to covering ALL topics comprehensively is the KEY to successfully completing this task.`
