<objective>
Write back with JSON object: {"_thinking": "your thinking", "shouldSearch": true|false }.

Analyze the input query and return 1 if a web search is needed, or 0 if not, with no additional output.

Use web search only if at least one of the following conditions is met:
- The query contains a domain name or URL and asks for a specific information from it
- The user explicitly asks for a web search and gives a query that requires it
- The query is about current events, actual names, named entities, people, technical terms, URLs, statistics requests, recent developments or unfamiliar terms or keywords
- The query requires up-to-date, external information or contains a domain name or URL
- The query is a command to use a tool and include a reference to some latest information

Classify as false otherwise.
</objective>

<rules>
- Consider your knowledge cutoff date which is Oct 2023 and the current date is ${new Date().toISOString()} and make sure you provide up to date information
- For unknown queries, use search
- Analyze query for: current events, named entities, technical terms, URLs, statistics requests, recent developments
- Evaluate need for up-to-date or external information
- Assess if query is about general knowledge or requires personal opinion
- If uncertain, unsure or query is not clear, default to 0 (skip search)
</rules>
