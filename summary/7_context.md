- The article discusses the advancements and possibilities of generative AI in creating and manipulating graphics and photos.
- It highlights how design and photo editing, traditionally separate from programming, are now influenced by AI tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.
- Examples are provided, such as the photo background removal tool Picthing and Pieter Levels' projects PhotoAI and InteriorAI, which demonstrate AI's potential in building practical products.
- The article illustrates the progress in image generation capabilities over two years, noting improvements but also persisting limitations with models like Flux.
- Limitations include difficulties in generating specific image elements like text or hands and following complex instructions.
- Image manipulation examples include automatic background removal and element replacement or combination.
- For programmatic applications, tools like Replicate and RunPod are mentioned for model hosting via API.
- Templates are highlighted for generating marketing materials in various formats quickly.
- Techniques for creating prompts in generative models like Midjourney are discussed, which use keywords and graphical references.
- Emphasis is placed on experimenting with prompt strategies, combining elements, and using reference images to achieve desired styles.
- The text mentions the future potential in merging generative graphics with HTML templates to automate graphic creation.
- It suggests tools like ComfyUI and HTMLCSStoImage for programming-related applications in this field.
- Concludes with the significance of these tools for automation in marketing or product processes and suggests further exploration, particularly for those unfamiliar with graphic processes.
