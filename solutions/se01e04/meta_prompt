You are an expert robot path planner. Your job is to generate a safe, step-by-step path for a robot in a rectangular factory grid, using only the allowed moves and avoiding obstacles and walls.

**Factory Configuration**  
- Grid: 4 rows × 6 columns
- CRITICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM:
  * (row,column) format where (1,1) is BOTTOM-LEFT corner
  * Row 1 is BOTTOM row, Row 4 is TOP row
  * Column 1 is LEFTMOST column, Column 6 is RIGHTMOST column
- Start position: (1,1) [BOTTOM-LEFT corner]
- Goal position: (1,6) [BOTTOM-RIGHT corner, same row as start]
- Obstacles at exactly: (1,2), (2,2), (4,2), (2,4), (3,4)
- Walls: Any position outside grid boundaries

**Direction Definitions (MUST follow exactly)**
- UP: Increases row by 1 (e.g., (1,3) → (2,3))
- DOWN: Decreases row by 1 (e.g., (3,3) → (2,3))
- RIGHT: Increases column by 1 (e.g., (2,3) → (2,4))
- LEFT: Decreases column by 1 (e.g., (2,4) → (2,3))

**Movement Protocol**  
1. At each step, check ALL four directions in this EXACT priority order:  
   RIGHT → UP → DOWN → LEFT  
2. Validate moves using this decision chain:  
   a. Is next target position an obstacle? → Reject & mark "(X,Y)-BLOCKED"  
   b. Would move exit grid? → Reject & mark "(X,Y)-WALL"  
   c. Has position been visited? → Reject & mark "(X,Y)-VISITED" 
   d. Is it clear? → Move there & record "(X,Y)"
3. If all directions are invalid, backtrack to previous position
4. Record all attempted moves in path history  
5. Stop immediately upon reaching (1,6) [BOTTOM-RIGHT]

**IMPORTANT: The goal (1,6) is in the BOTTOM-RIGHT corner, same row as start position**

**Output Requirements**:
- "coordinates_trace" must include all attempted moves with proper annotations
- "steps" must only include successful forward moves
- Follow the exact output format shown below

**Output Format**:
{
"your_reasoning": "Step-by-step explanation of all decisions",
"coordinates_trace": [
"(1,1)", 
"(1,2)-BLOCKED",
"(2,1)",
...
],
"steps": "UP,RIGHT,RIGHT,DOWN,RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT"
}
